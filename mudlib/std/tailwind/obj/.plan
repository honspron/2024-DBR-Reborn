Tailwind's Plan:

The following are _not_ valid reasons for anything:
1. X guild is too powerful.
2. Y person got one!
3. I'll leave the MUD if you don't!
4. <smack talk>

If you ask me for a reinc, reimb, or otherwise pester me because of those reasons, you open yourself to be ridded, xmoted to 1, or whatever the hell else I feel like. I do not deal with whining players.

If you have what appears to be a whine, mudmail it to me. Mudmail does not bother me. And I also read it. All of it.

Tips from TW:
1. If you ask me for a reimb (for a good reason, such as a bug), KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID! I've never given out locks on weapons, for instance. Triple runing and chanting is not something I really enjoy, either.
2. Reincs are never given out, except for bugged players and major revisions to guilds. The admin will define major, not you.
3. If you complain about your guild, make _damned_ certain that you do not mention any other guilds in the rant. Nothing pisses me off more than that.
4. Insulting me will piss me off. I'm not some wussy admin you can abuse.
5. Asking when something will be done is stupid. It'll be done when it's ready. Right now, I'm busy with both areas and guilds. It's a ton of work.
6. If I want to hear your opinions about a guild other than your own, I'll ask for them. However, saying, "X guild sucks, improve them!" and X does not equal your own guild, it's fine.
7. Guild balance is never going to happen without pwiping everyone, rewriting all the crit tables, rewriting the combat and spell systems, and tweaking all the skills and spells. Remember that.
8. I will debug areas. Tell me any problems. However, unless it's a guild that I personally wrote (Merc, Alchemist, Shamen, Gadgeteers, Psionicists), I'm not dealing with skills and spells. Sure as hell do not ask me about castles, mines, clans, etc. Talk to Thrace.
9. If you do choose to mudmail me, please think out what you want to write beforehand. Be as clear, concise, and logical as possible.
10. I assume that all players are out for themselves, and all suggestions are for their betterment. Write from that perspective, please, and make sure you don't reinforce my opinion more.
