__Letter "We brought up that remorting could be tyed in to cross training between guilds. I know that I opened it up to cross train any guild but the idea would be remort once you can cross train between 1 other guild remort a 2nd time you can cross train between 2 guilds and so on I keep my same values in that reference between related and non related guilds but you can only corss train after remorting. We remove the current system allowing anyone to cross train with any guild with as many as they want. It makes more sense to limit it."
