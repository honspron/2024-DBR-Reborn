__Letter "Hello!Exash here. How are you? I was trying to log in, but for some reason the game doesn't accept my password, although a few months ago it worked perfectly. I even extracted that password from my old logs and tried the login, just to be sure that I'm using the exact same password, but unfortunately it didn't let me in. If you'll have some time, could you take a look please? Could something change with authentication methods or something else? I'm glad to see there are players again, and that DBR is the 2nd most voted mud on MudVerse :) are there any news about the DBR2 codebase, or the guy who has it is still unavailable? Also, I remember I started to look into the castle-related autosaving things, is it still an issue, or it got fixed over the time? How do players like this system without the \"mental state\" or how it was called, which prevented getting XP after a specific amount?Let me know if there are any critical bugs and then if I'll have time I can be a bit more active again (and if I'll be able to log in :D ), just a lot changed in real life over the past two years and it was/is very very busy.Thank you!Exash"
