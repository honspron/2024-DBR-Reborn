__Letter "Hello,If I remember well you were who reported iron will's too low duration, so because I can't follow whose alt is who, I'm sending out this mail. The iron will duration was adjusted from 40 seconds to 300 seconds, and this is the base duration for 1st power level, so for higher power levels multipliers should apply (I hope). If it's still not good, please let me know.Have fun,Exash"
