__Letter "Hello,Well it can be a few things... they go netdead like the game officially tells them that they are linkdead and their connection gets closed, or it's more like your router, when having no traffic on a given connection, drops them? Is it possible the ISP changed some setting on the router controlling this behavior?That can cause such things too... that's one possibility.E."
