short:::The Forge-Master's Trove
long:::Towering shelves of gleaming gold and glittering gems line the              
walls of this cavernous chamber, the accumulated wealth of                  
generations of master craftsmen. Piles of rare and exotic                   
materials sit in orderly stacks, waiting to be transformed into             
legendary artifacts, each worth more than a kingdom's ransom.               
In the center, a massive stone table displays the Forge-Master's            
most prized creations, each one a testament to unparalleled skill           
and vision.
