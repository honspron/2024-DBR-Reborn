short:::The Nexus of Wonders
long:::Shimmering veils of magic dance through the air of this vast,               
circular chamber, where dozens of master artisans work tirelessly           
at enchanted forges and mystical workbenches. The rhythmic                  
clanging of hammers on celestial metals blends with the soft                
chanting of runesmiths, creating an otherworldly symphony of                
creation. At the center, a swirling vortex of pure energy                   
pulses, feeding raw power into the legendary artifacts taking               
shape around the room.
