Shards

Shards is the first area of the "Demonic Ring Trilogy".

Shards is located on the "other continent", where the goblins are. It is way across the sea, and unreachable by the players... till now. A magic portal has opened, designed by arch-mages to open 200 years after casting.

The demonic invasion was thought to have begun relatively recently. Not so - the demons really invaded the "mythical" Shards over 200 years ago, looking for a artifact of incredible power, a ring.

They would not find it, as arch-mages had long since teleported it to a distant land - Lomdin. The demons trashed the town and everything around it anyways, and to this day, are still looking for the ring.

Scattered throughout Shards are crystals, containing messages from former inhabitants. One must only "feel" the crystal, and it will come to life, projecting a message for the toucher.
