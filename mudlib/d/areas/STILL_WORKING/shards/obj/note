The note reads as follows:

Thank Lidfino for the enchanters! They managed to put a spell of protection over this library, so that none could enter for 101 years. I'm guessing that the invades will be gone by then, and someone will find this note.

As I write, most of the city is being systematically destroyed by seven foot tall demons. No one has the faintest idea of where they came from - they just started destroying everything on the road to the city one day. A few souls have ventured that something or someone here attracted them. That could be - but if they aren't from this dimension, how on Lomdin did they get here?

My missive has stretched long enough. I must return to the fighting now.

In truth,
Captain Ascon of the City Militia
