Major change to HP and MP for all guilds so that casters have increased hp and mundance classes such as fighter and Tinker get a boost to MP gain per a level so if they choose to cross train they can. Their regen for HP also are adjusted to scale accordingly. Caster guilds still get the most MP and most MP regen.
