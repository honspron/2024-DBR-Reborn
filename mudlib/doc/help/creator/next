i have everything maxed at level 23
for a pure spellcaster that seems sad
also if we can change the enchanting of weapons and make it based on enchantment skill instead of random luck i think that would be a great improvement.

Tlny — 05/24/2020
WPs - make it so call weapons can be unwielded to be spelled up
And if dropped they disappear
Tlny — 05/24/2020
Update weapons/armor so that skill increases potency when crafting it, perhaps increases durability of weapons, so it degrades slower, and or increases the amount of magic an item can hold. And for armor increase the AC of it by a small percantage  - Also make it so there are patterns for learning runes, and have the runes based on certain 'skills'
Tlny — 05/24/2020
Oh, make body block togglable
Tlny — 05/24/2020
perhaps a personalize skill for tinkers, allowing them to use it on a weapon/armor to give it bonuses for them only, reduces it for everyone else..

For visibility: If you accidentally use a long-term skill on an item on the ground, there's no obvious way to cancel the action now. You can pick up the item, drop the item, walk away from the item, the skill will still keep counting down until it completes.

I think there's something wonky with indomitable
spirit. first time I cast it this afternoon after logging back on it got
the paramoor is now resistant to stunning.  Ever since then, when i cast
it, I get the message that paramoor is already resistant to stunning.  It's
like it never wears off once it's cast.
Tlny] that meanns the person that made that spell applied it
directly to your character sheet witch is dumb way to do spells

Can we get the prices adjusted in shop, say for powerstones, parchment, chests(tinkers should be able to use carpentry to make them), mine prices.
Also, perhaps for long term exp, for spells and tinker, make it the same, based on skill used. Though spell lvls can adjust it a lil. Or use Atothek's code...steal it!

it's 2020, get rid of timing out idle players... a) CPU resources are emphatically not an issue for muds anymore, and b) the number one factor that determines whether a new player will stay for more than 30 seconds is how many people they see online, it is infinitely better to have 30 afk players on your who list than 5 active ones

And maybe repair weapon could repair tiers with an extra ingot, for instance: repair sword from superb with an extra ingot
Tlny — 06/13/2020

Tlny — 06/18/2020
Is there anyway to get something added where we can see the stats/skills/spells of familiars just to know what they have/how powerful they are.  This Drake keeps trying to show me up by casting spells I dont know he has!

quirk with portals created from aether crits and areas that have enter as the way into them.  Quarry for example.  - killed the sentry which during combat portals were created.  Unable to get into the quarry since "enter" goes into a portal instead of going into the quarry.
