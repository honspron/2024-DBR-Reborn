                  =-=-=- Alchemist -=-=-=
 
	Alchemists are an economic guild which creates potions,
oils, pets, and much more. They have all of the lore skills
in the MUD available to train, such as poison lore and herb
lore. Alchemists are no slouches as fighters, either - they have
all the important combat skills at their disposal. In addition,
they can create golems, which require a long build time, but are
immensely powerful.
 
Type:   Scientific Semi Warrior
Skills: Combat, economic, and some miscellaneous skills.
Spells: Damage runes and misc spells. Nothing really in the
direct damage department.
Prime Attributes: None. Alchemists can do it all, but should
be balanced.
 
Examples: Think of one of today's scientists, medievally.
Comments: The Alchemist is like a tink or enchanter in that he
        is there "for the money", and not so much for combat.
        Again, Alchemists are not push-overs; when enhanced,
        they are quite fearsome.
