    Beneath the silvered glow of moonlight, the ancient blood of the weredragon stirs. Unlike their bestial cousins, the transformation of a weredragon is less tethered to the moon's phases and more to their emotions and inner fire. When rage flares or danger looms, their human guise yields to shimmering scales, mighty wings, and claws imbued with draconic power. 

By daylight, the weredragon maintains greater control over their dual nature, though the pull of their draconic heritage remains ever-present, a constant whisper in their soul. With time and discipline, some gain mastery over their transformations, shifting at will to harness the strength of the dragon within. Their draconic form grants immense resistance to mundane weapons, their scaled hide impervious to anything short of magic or the mightiest of blows. 

Powerful, mysterious, and awe-inspiring, the weredragon straddles the line between man and dragon, an embodiment of ancient majesty and untamed fury.
