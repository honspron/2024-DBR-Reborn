Shamen, unlike the Naturalists, are not in the business of
dominating nature to serve their own needs. Rather, they "ask"
favors of the land, and vow to serve it in exchange. This trade
works well, and any who would seek to defile or tame the land
for their own, selfish purposes must fight through a shaman
first...
 
Type:   Priest
Skills: Spell-casting and miscellaneous skills.
Spells: Summoning, and weapon and armor creation/enhancement.
Prime Attributes: Str, Wis
 
Examples: The old tribal leaders of Native Americans.
Comments: Shamen make their own weapons and armor by summoning
          fantastical monsters, and capturing their essences
          into Shaman Jewels. These jewels power all spell-
          ups, armour/weapon creation, and direct damage
          spells. Since jewels power them, they cast
          very quickly and with very little mp cost. However,
          it is time-consuming to make and charge such
          jewels.
