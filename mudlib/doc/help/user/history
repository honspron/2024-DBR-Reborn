-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This is a quick history of the making of DayBreak Ridge Reborn. 

1993  Diewarzau & Vishnu took over DarkeMUD from Drake U. (DarkeMUD I)
1994  DarkeMUD was lost on a computer... ACK! (DarkeMUD II)
1994  Diewarzau & Drizzt recovered the mud and moved it to
        Impaler at Rice U.
      Drizzt redesigned DarkeMUD... I.E. a new combat and skill
        system.  Diewarzau, Drizzt, & Warsyn designed the rest of 
        the mud.  (DarkeMUD III)  DarkeMUD also moved to mudOS.
1994  Late that winter the mud was lost again at Rice U.
1995  Blade gave us a temp. site which we moved the mud to after
        recovering from Rice.  Diewarzau, Drizzt, Mikus, and Warsyn 
        revised the design of (DarkeMUD IV) into the present system. 
        We backup the mud a lot now!
1996  Feb. 10th DarkeMUD moved to shadowlands.com at ICSI for its 
        permanent home.  The admin purchased a 486-120 w/ 32megs.
1996  Feb. 18th, 3am  DarkeMUD tried to open.
1996  Early March we went back to beta due to some bugs with the
        locker system and we decided to wait till we rounded off
        all of the guilds
1996  Early April we wizlocked the mud to get more work done.
1996  May 15th, The DarkeMUD webpage was redone by Drizzt.
1996  May 30th, 10am DarkeMUD officially opened!!!
1996    - Mid-Late 96 Clan system was added, Darke moved to a P-166 
          with 64megs then was later upgraded to 128megs with a 8meg
          caching controller.
1996    - The Great Loss - Darkemud lost its site, the computer (which
	  was purchased through player donations), and its lib.  It
	  looked as though it would never return.
1997    - The Great Return - Nikodemus decided he was tired of hearing
          folks whine about missing Darke on the internet, so he massmailed
          every single address he could find, garnered support and
          convinced Shadowraith, Nevin, and Maxwell to restore the mud.
          Nevin made a lib appear from thin air, Mactorg donated a site,
          Maxwell said he would code and Shadowraith put it all in a pot
          and stirred.
1997  Parnell (Anickuf from DarkeMUD) got a copy from Drizzt
1997~ Parnell Traer and Thrace started Daybreak Ridge
2000  Parnell plays everquest and gives up on Daybreak Ridge
2018  Parnell open sources the lib using FluffOS
2018  Tlny Finds the DarkeLIB code online posted by Parnell 
    and spends countless hours trying to get it to work with 
    no success. He asks developers coworkers friends to help 
    him get the DarkeLIB code to work. No one can figure it out.
    Tlny has never coded in his life and has only played MUD.
2019  December 25th Tlny asks his brother the only thing he wants
    for Christmas is to spin up the DarkeLIB. After only 15 minutes
    his brother get's everything up and running. So excited
    Tlny Spends every day highly modify and fixing every piece
    of the code and calls it DayBreak Ridge REBORN!
    Tlny self Teaches himself how to code spending countless hours
    learning to code by reverse breaking and fixing every file he finds.
2020  Tlny Fixes many of the broken parts of DayBreak Ridge such as
    World Mapping save code, adds in new areas adds in randon loot code
    completely revamps all of combat code adds in a tun of areas and new 
    spells and skills. Touches every code file.
