                  =-=-=- Mercenaries -=-=-=
 
	Mercenaries are the gritty, back-alley types that you
don't really want to run into. They like to be stealthy and
dishonorable, and work for those who pay them the highest salary.
There is no honor among thieves - or mercenaries, as they are
discouraged from showing any guild loyalty at all. The standard
mercenary pays a lot for his equipment, as he will usually wield
two weapons at once.
 
Type:   Pure Warrior
Skills: Combat skills. Mercs get offhand training and dual attack
        very early, and also get a variant of back stab.
Spells: None. Only wimps use spells, according to the generic
        mercenary.
Prime Attributes: Str, Con, Dex.
 
Examples: Think of a chaotic-lord who didn't even do the Chaos
        thing, but was only out for himself.
Comments: The Mercenary guild is designed to be a guild which uses
        two weapons at once - exclusively. They are capable of
        doing insane damage with their "sneak attack" skill,
        which, unlike back stab, does NOT require a dagger.
        If players RP this guild right, it could be quite
        good.
