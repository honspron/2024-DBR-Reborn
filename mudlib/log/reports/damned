Bug reported by Lilund:
/d/damned/guilds/tinker/train_room: so i dont know if this qualifies as a
bug, or a balance issue. could be either so let me explain. the game has many
different aoe spells from many different guilds (area of effect). however,
only a few work. by that i mean only a few are capable of casting and not
being fully resisted by the enemy mobs. a good example is wog (wrath of god),
its a warpriest guild aoe spell. when casting at enemy mobs near my level
(like 10 levels + or -) it gets fully resisted every time bt all the mobs (as
far as ive noticed). essentially its useless and i cannot use it when
edventuring and sometimes really need an aoe spell lol. for example i was
fighting a mob (a dragon) that spawns baby dragons. well my buffs had dropped
dt,bok,boa and when that happened my stats fell low enough i could no longer
strike the mob woth my weapon because my skill was to low vs the dragons.
well rhe dragon doesnt let you leave the room its a boss of sorts, and so
there i was. i could t recast buffs because of the shadow buff bug (wich you
may have just fixed) and my aoe spell is fully resisted by everything
so....lol next thing i knew there were 100 dragons on me and i started to lag
the whole server. thankfully tlny was on and he cleared the room for me..
like insaid notnsure if thisnisnyour realm as im not sure its a bug. may in
fact just be a balance issue. but its worth looking into because this
(affects Most Players). it affects guilds that are mele focused like tinker
and warrior, thief, etc. we dont have alot of spell options that we can
afford and otherwise we dont have aoe and can get stuck as mentioned above.
hit me up if theres anything you can do about thos because i know several
spells that act in this manner. and could discuss with you the intended power
of each of them (from a lore/ logical perspective). would affect many guilds
and players positively if its your area of expertise

Bug reported by Yorik:
/d/damned/guilds/join_rooms/war-priest_join: The help file for heavenly blade
says it can be stacked twice. However, after casting it once, if I cast it
again, i get the message You may not imbue this weapon with any more evil
power. This is a paladin spell, NOt sure why it says evil, and not sure why I
can't cast it twice per the help file.
