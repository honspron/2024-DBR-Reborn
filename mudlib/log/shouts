tlny (echoall): %^YELLOW%^Tlny: %^BOLD%^%^RED%^ Major changes to Flame blade, Icy weapon, Elecrtic Blade, vacuum weapon, Firestorm blade, vacid weapon, lightning blade
tlny (echoall): %^YELLOW%^Tlny: %^BOLD%^%^RED%^ Please be WARNED Tyranid Area is going over complete overhaul
tlny (echoall): %^YELLOW%^Tlny: %^BOLD%^%^RED%^ you can new set your title at any level with title command or with the setenv TITLE command
tlny (echoall): %^YELLOW%^Tlny: %^BOLD%^%^RED%^ I have been working on redoing Tyranid area I have spent the past 5 hours redoing all the beginning levels the first 2-3 levels of mobs have been fully remade including the new loot system and scaling with the mods based on it. As you go deep in the Tyranid hive mobs get increasingly stronger as well the loot also increases based on the mobs you hunt. Please note I am not finished working on it and I have to edit each mob individually. This is a warning to all adventures. The difficulty of the Tyranid hive has increased significantly but the reward is also just as great
tlny (echoall): %^YELLOW%^Tlny: %^BOLD%^%^RED%^ I am not even close to done yet so if you go very deep the mobs have not been remade yet so expect them to be wimpy and no loot
tlny (echoall): %^YELLOW%^Tlny: %^BOLD%^%^RED%^ Changes made to Blessing of agility Blessing of knowledge and divine Might they are now single cast same effect but you only need to cast it one time the duration has increased significantly for all these spells Descriptions for those 3 spells just updated as well
tlny (echoall): %^YELLOW%^Tlny: %^BOLD%^%^RED%^ changes made to bags of holding. first you can't steal them 2nd the bag itself while empty will save Please make sure when you look at the bag that you read the entire description. as any contents in the bag on log out will drop to the ground and I am not responsible for any loss of items within bags when you quit log out or disconnect I believe the system how it works now is great I have no plans to change them further. and bags of holding from the store can store a little bit more weight. Question for the MUD does anyone know if you can make bags of holding with spells and any other locations of them besides the store in DBR? I need to know this as no other bags of holdings have been changed only the ones bought from the magic store in DBR Scrolls of Daybreak (New ones only) can not be stolen anymore on next reboot it will apply to them all ^
