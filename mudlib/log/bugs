/d/daybreak/room/db_square: clone does not work correctly, when casting clone
and engaging in combat the game screen (not sure if it just laged me out or
the server) turned black and flickered. i got out of combat through memory
and movement commands to leave the area but ultimately had to log off and
back on to play again and see the screen. also the clone and me do not appear
to correctly cast spells. the clone is supposed to mirror my apells but when
buffing up (wich is inportant because when ny clone dies i will take damage
so me and mt clone need!! to buff up) not all the biffs would land on both of
us. clone is a sword mage spell if that helps. (priority low, does bot affect
many players aka non essential spell/interaction)

/d/daybreak/room/db_square: Divine transformation(dt) paladin guild spell

Bug reported by Lilund Sat Dec 10 23:24:58 2022:
/d/damned/guilds/tinker/train_room: so i dont know if this qualifies as a
bug, or a balance issue. could be either so let me explain. the game has many
different aoe spells from many different guilds (area of effect). however,
only a few work. by that i mean only a few are capable of casting and not
being fully resisted by the enemy mobs. a good example is wog (wrath of god),
its a warpriest guild aoe spell. when casting at enemy mobs near my level
(like 10 levels + or -) it gets fully resisted every time bt all the mobs (as
far as ive noticed). essentially its useless and i cannot use it when
edventuring and sometimes really need an aoe spell lol. for example i was
fighting a mob (a dragon) that spawns baby dragons. well my buffs had dropped
dt,bok,boa and when that happened my stats fell low enough i could no longer
strike the mob woth my weapon because my skill was to low vs the dragons.
well rhe dragon doesnt let you leave the room its a boss of sorts, and so
there i was. i could t recast buffs because of the shadow buff bug (wich you
may have just fixed) and my aoe spell is fully resisted by everything
so....lol next thing i knew there were 100 dragons on me and i started to lag
the whole server. thankfully tlny was on and he cleared the room for me..
like insaid notnsure if thisnisnyour realm as im not sure its a bug. may in
fact just be a balance issue. but its worth looking into because this
(affects Most Players). it affects guilds that are mele focused like tinker
and warrior, thief, etc. we dont have alot of spell options that we can
afford and otherwise we dont have aoe and can get stuck as mentioned above.
hit me up if theres anything you can do about thos because i know several
spells that act in this manner. and could discuss with you the intended power
of each of them (from a lore/ logical perspective). would affect many guilds
and players positively if its your area of expertise

/d/daybreak/room/db_square: exash: clone is bugged. it is a sword mage guild
spell that when cast is supposed to create a duplicate copy of you that will
cast the same spells as you and fight as you exactlt as you are. when buffing
up with spells from the paladin guild (and others) like divine transformation
or blessing of knowledge etc they dont always apply to both the clone and the
player....also in combat my screen went black wen i tried to engage with a
clone spell active. it is critical that the clone recieves spell ups and
behaves exactly like myself sonce if it dies i will take 50% of my hp in
damage...also obciously bugging out the screen is a no go...

/d/daybreak/room/db_square: exash: thieves guild ability lock smithing does
not work. lock smithing is an ability that is supposed to use a material (key
blank easily bought from the thieves store shop) to create a key while
picking a lock of the lock that you are opening. when succesful essentially
you open the door/chest/etc but also end up with a usable key for that
door/chest until it degrades over time (the key degrades). but the skill does
not work at all. (not auper high priority as pick locks does work..but still)

/d/daybreak/room/db_square: exash: skill body block. found in numerous guilds
auch as fighter. is a skill that is supposed to make you take hits for your
party (so instead of the mage getting hit you take the hit. tanky kind of
thing). im told it is missing code and unreliable. needs to be looked into,
also if possible as im unfamiliar with the mechanic of it..it should be a
skill that is goggle-able. that way if you arent the best tank you can turn
it off and let the better tank recieve the blows? (low priority but it is a
skill present in a handful of guilds so needs to be fixed eventually)

/d/daybreak/room/db_square: exash: the ?who? command is a great way to check
who is online, your progression vs others (competitiveness) and general
bragging rights. the who list generates itself such that the higher level you
are the higher you place on the list. its also broken down into categories of
progression, so mortal is lvl 0-35, high mortal 35-60, and hero 60-500. most
of us would love to have that 60-500 broken down further into additional
milestones. but the coding for it has always resulted in critical errors to
the mud!!! if possible look into this, but be careful i guess its a bitch
lol: if you can crack it and not break the mud heres my personal suggestion: 
60-99 HERO.....100-199 legend......200-299 Ancient.....300-399
Eternal......400-499 Immortal..... 500+ Demi-God
